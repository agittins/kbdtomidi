# kbdtomidi - TODO List #

- add support for a config file so that we can:
 - map keycodes to specific notes / controllers
 - set a button to be a toggle or momentary
 - other stuffs?

- add mouse support so people can build expression pedals or similar using mice (pointer movement and buttons/wheels)
