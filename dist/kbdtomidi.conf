# run the keyboard-to-midi daemon
#
# kbdtomidi takes exclusive control of an input device and generates midi
# events from the button presses instead of keyboard events.
# 
# This script it for whatever init system fedora used between sysv and systemd
# maybe it was upstart? I honestly don't remember. This probably isn't the file
# you want, take a look at the .conf file which is for systemd.
